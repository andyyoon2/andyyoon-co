**Throwing more of my life into this Notion.** Trying to figure out how best to organize things. But it's nice to have things down somewhere outside of my brain. Helps me clear the space in my mind. Still need to make mind maps, boards for NBB, other side hustles, Gold, Garett's strokes band, OC Groove, Uni, vinyl collecting, I'm involved in a lot.

**Went to the orthopedic specialist for a check-up today.** He said I have a *minor radial head fracture*. Basically keep it in a sling but it's not needed 24/7, and don't lift things more than a pound. 3 weeks then follow up. This happened while I was playing basketball, I tried to jump over a tennis net and my foot got snagged, causing me to tip in the air and come down directly on my wrists.

Having some ideas of travel. Take 1 week off and go to a **nice ass** ski resort? Maybe. Impromptu road trip somewhere? Maybe. It's easier to just pick a date and decide, so this maybe business goes away.

## Insight

*Last night*, I still had my near-full-arm splint from urgent care on. It was very itchy and uncomfortable, to the point where I couldn't sleep. I was trying to tap into the meditative mindset, holding the feeling and weighing it, rather than being angry and annoyed. It was tough, I fought back some anxiety. I'm so lucky and happy I don't need a cast.

I got the stamp of approval about this meditation technique from Guru Ryan.
